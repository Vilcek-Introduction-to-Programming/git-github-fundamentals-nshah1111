I have never used GitHub before so most of this was new to me. I have used RStudio before but never in combination with GitHub.
  I also have many friends in the computer science so most of what I knew of Git was through diffusion. It was nice to actually use it.
  It was interesting to learn about how repositories work and the tools they provide. I could definetely see this being useful in the future
I am still confused by some of the functions and tools of GitHub. For example, the difference between Pull Downs and Commits. 
Also, on a more fundamental level, I don't understand why someone would choose GitHub over Google Drive or another filesharing app. They seem to accomplish the same thing.
  GitHub seems very useful for coders and people working with large datasets and algorithms, but for a scientist like me who uses little code it seems like too much.

One of the suggestions Wilson et al. suggest is a good practice for computational reproducibility is creating an overview of the project.
This can be a README file, where all necessary information is kept. This can include contact information, a summary of the project, and a guide to the directories and folders present.
Git/GitHub can be useful in this regard because the README file can be easily accessed by everyone in the repository. Additionally, anyone can edit it as necessary and create a pull request.
  This allows for information to be as accurate as possible and any confusions regarding the README can be solved quickly.
